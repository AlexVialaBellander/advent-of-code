    "Here I got really stuck, I didnt understand how to think of the problem until much later. At first I attempted to check if there were sequences that were repeated and thought one could creaet a shortcut mapping, think memoization. But a check revealed that that was not what was causing my solution to be slow.\n",

If there was remains of the original range we then call the function recursively with the same parameters to check if there are any more overlaps with other ranges for the type.\n",

    "#### ChatGPT Summary\n",
    "**Range Splitting and Transformation:** It splits an initial range into overlapping and non-overlapping segments relative to a set of predefined ranges. For each overlapping part, it applies an offset to transform the range into the target type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Processing:** The function handles the non-overlapping parts of the initial range recursively, ensuring that the entire range is transformed according to the mapping rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aggregation and Optimization:** After processing, the function aggregates all the transformed ranges and selects the one with the smallest starting point. This ensures the most optimal transformation result."
