    "We project a straight orthogonal line from each point onto the y=2000000 line. For each sensor, we then check if the n1 distance between the intersection of the line and the sensor is larger than the sensor's range. If the sensor's range is larger, it means that the line was reachable by the sensor. We then calculate the difference between the n1 distance and the range of the sensor, since it is larger, we know that the residual distance can be used to reach nearby points on the y-line. We then add the residual distance to the total distance covered by the sensors."

For each point, beginning with the first (0,0), we check the n1 distance between the point and the sensors. We then calculate the residual distance.
