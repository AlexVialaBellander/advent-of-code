Then we iterativly check for each knot, if the parent knot is in the vicinity of it (within a 3x3 grid). If not, we use their relative position to determine whether we should move diagonally or straight. We update the knots position and then move on to the child knot. If ever, a knot doesn't need to move, then we break since no child will have to move either."

    "Today also took quite some time, however, I think that today had the largest time gap between puzzle 1 and puzzle 2. My initial solution for p1 did not work with extention on p2. This is because I assumed that when a knot was not in the vicnity of its parent, it would move to where the parent was. This works in the single not case but not with multiple knots. It took quite some time to figure out that the proper motion of the knots were to move diagonally if the parent was not in the same row or column. I read the example for almost an hour and could not understand why certain moves were done, they felt inconsistent with the explained rules. Anyhow, I think I have a better understanding of the problem now and I think I can solve it in a more elegant way.\n",
